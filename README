free_graph - graph drawing library for c/c++ (linux)
=====================================================

using this library you can draw a graph of a equation in given x and y range and
write it into a bitmap of given width and height.

compiling source :
------------------ 

source of the library are include int he "src" directory. to create object code run,

	gcc -Wall -c -fpic free_graph.c fg_error.c structs.h

int he commend line. now to create the library files run,

	gcc -Wall -shared -o libfree_graph.so free_graph.o fg_error.o structs.h

then the "libfree_graph.so" file will be created.

copy it to the "/usr/lib" directory.

	sudo cp libfree_graph.so /usr/lib

now copy "free_graph.h", "fg_structs.h" and "fg_error.h" files to "/usr/include" directory.

	sudo cp free_graph.h /usr/include
	sudo cp fg_structs.h /usr/include
	sudo cp fg_error.h /usr/include


you can also use already compiled library file and header file in lib directory.
copy the to the above directories.

compiling demo :
----------------

you need gtk to compile "demo" . install it by running,

	sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev

on terminal. then simply type make. double click on compiled file to run it

using free_graph:
-----------------

use "fg_init" and "fg_clear_graph" before drwaing any thing (graph or grid or lines).
try to use small x and y ranges to make the graph more accurate.
